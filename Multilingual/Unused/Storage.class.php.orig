/**
 * Multilingual Markdown generator - Storage class
 *
 * The Storage class handles buffers for reading paragraphs from an input file and writing languages parts in output files.
 * The filenames and pathes are not handles by Storage, which uses file handles sent by the caller. The file is neither opened
 * nor closed by Storage but the current file positions are modified by Storage when reading and writing, so callers should not
 * rely on positions nor alter them.
 *
 * See the Filer class for file names handling and files opening.
