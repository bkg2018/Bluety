Annonce forum RC2014.

Hi all.

In 2020 I've been designing and building an I/O control board with 2 ports and many bells and whistles for the SC126 and RC2014-Pro in a blue case everybody can buy on various commercial sites. I developped a front and back panel as well as a bus relay board. I called the whole ensemble BLUETY - sounds like beauty - and tried to get the components and boards as blue as possible.

After an awful amount of time and work I finished my 3rd version and I was quite happy, I wanted to sell it as a kit on Tindie but estimated the cost at about â‚¬100 plus the case, which I found way too expensive and I kinda gave up.

Then life kept me away from the RC2014 universe and it took me some time to get back, rework documentation to rip off any kit mention and come back here to give access to the various project assets. I think it would be nice for peoples to get all necessary docs and files if they want to build or rework this.

Here are the various links to Bluety assets, all is public access.

The blue case is available at least on Amazon, AliExpress, BangGood, eBay, just look for "Blue Metal Electronic Enclosures" and take dimensions 250x190x110 cms. It's highly probable the Chinese furnisher behind this will package them insufficiently protected so be prepared for slightly damaged corners.

I hope some of you will make something out of all this.

In case you'd be willing to buy a kit from me, unfortunately I don't plan to do that. But I have 8 sets of boards and 2 sets of high quality components left, so just ask me in private.
